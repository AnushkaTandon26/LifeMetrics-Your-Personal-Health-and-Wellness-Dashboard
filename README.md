Arduino Temperature, Humidity, and Heart Rate Monitor

This project uses an Arduino to measure temperature, humidity, and heart rate with a DHT22 sensor and a pulse sensor, displaying the results on an LCD screen. It’s a basic health monitoring system for displaying environmental conditions and heart rate.

Components

- Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DHT22 Sensor - Measures temperature and humidity.
- Pulse Heart Rate Sensor - Measures heartbeats.
- 16x2 LCD Display - Shows temperature, humidity, and heart rate.
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires - For connections between components.

 Wiring

- DHT22 Sensor: Connect to a digital pin (pin 2 in the code).
- Pulse Sensor: Connect the signal pin to analog pin A0.
- LCD: Connect as per the LCD’s pin configuration, matching the digital pins (pins 3 to 6, 11, and 12 in the code).

Code Overview

1. Setup:
   - Initializes the DHT22, pulse sensor, and LCD.
   
2. Main Loop:
   - Reads temperature, humidity, and heart rate data.
   - Displays data on the LCD and Serial Monitor.
   - Detects heartbeats using a threshold and indicates if a heartbeat is detected.

Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino.
2. Connect all components as described.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to see real-time data.
4. View temperature, humidity, and heart rate on the LCD screen.
This README provides an overview, wiring details, and usage instructions for the health monitoring project using Arduino.
